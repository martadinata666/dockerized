A simple example of how to add yacron to a docker image.  To try it out,
run for instance:

	$ docker build -t yacrondemo .
	$ docker run -ti yacrondemo -l DEBUG  # Ctrl-C to stop

Moreover, you can find an example of deploying to Kubernetes in the
``k8s-deploy.yaml`` file.  To test:

	$ kubectl apply -f k8s-deploy.yaml
	deployment "yacrondemo" created

Check that the pod was created:

	$ kubectl get pods -l app=yacrondemo
	NAME                         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
	yacrondemo-cffff957f-9dt5r   1/1       Running   0          1m

Follow the logs from the pod:

	$ kubectl logs --timestamps -f yacrondemo-cffff957f-9dt5r

(hit Ctrl-C to stop following logs)

To undo the changes and stop the pod:

	$ kubectl delete deployment yacrondemo
	deployment "yacrondemo" deleted
